<h1>This text needs to replaced with a component showing Airbnb style image grid</h1>
<p>See <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20238974">the link</a> for an example. The ideal component will make use of Flowbite-Svelte and Tailwind CSS</p>
<p>The grid should be dynamic and interactive and work for multiple screen sizes similiar to the one on Airbnb</p>
<p>Example images can be found in image_data.json</p>
